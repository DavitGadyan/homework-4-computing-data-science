# Create a function called "has_experience_as"
# that has two parameters:
# 1. A list of CV's.
# 2. A string (job_title)
#
# The function should return a list of strings
# representing the usernames of every user that
# has worked as job_title.



#
# 5)
# Create a function called "job_counts"
# that has one parameter: list of CV's
# and returns a dictionary where the
# keys are the job titles and the values
# are the number of users that have done
# that job.



#
# 6)
# Create a function, called "most_popular_job"
# that has one parameter: a list of CV's, and
# returns a tuple (str, int) that represents
# the title of the most popular job and the number
# of times it was held by people on the site.
#
# HINT: You should probably use your "job_counts"
# function!
